## About Me

I am currently a PhD student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), working on AI-powered healthcare applications and multimodal learning. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in June 2024, where I graduated with **Honored Research Degree** and **Outstanding Graduate** distinctions. During my undergraduate studies, I maintained a GPA of **3.99/4.0** (ranked **2/278**).

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of:
- **Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare**: Medical image analysis, ECG monitoring, Traditional Chinese Medicine
- **Multimodal Learning**: Cross-modal translation, visual-language models
- **Time Series Analysis**: Forecasting, anomaly detection, signal processing
- **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, transfer learning

## Recent Highlights

- 🏆 **Best Paper Award** at BigCom 2025 for our work on GraphRAG-empowered LLM for TCM knowledge retrieval
- 📚 Published paper accepted at **ICCCN 2023** on machine learning for cavitation fault diagnosis
- 🎓 Recipient of **Gratitude to Chinese Modern Scientists Scholarship** (Top 0.2%, 20,000 CNY)
- 🌏 Completed international exchange at **Nanyang Technological University, Singapore** (Top 10%)

I am passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world problems, particularly in healthcare and robotics. Feel free to reach out for research collaboration or academic discussion!
